    "1. Reverend Thomas Bayes (1702 - 1761), a British amateur mathemetician, wrote about how to combine an intial belief with new data to arrive at an improved belief.  This manuscript was published in 1763 (posthumously)\n",
    "2. In 1774 Pierre Simon Lapalace rediscovered and clarified Bayes' principles.  He applied these to astronomy, physics, population stats, jurisprudence (study of law).  By the way, he estimated the mass of Saturn and its uncertainty, which remains consistent with the best current measurements.\n",
    "3. In the early 20th century, Harold Jeffreys brought back Bayes' theorem and Laplace's work.\n",
    "4. Around 1960, proponents included Finetti, Savage, Wald, Jaynes.  Computing technology was taking off at this time.\n",

    "p(M|D) = \\frac{p(D|M)p(M)}{p(D)},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $D$ is data, $M$ is model. In other words, this is based on the likelihood fuction, applying Bayes' rule.  In words, Bayes' Theorem basically says:\n",
    "> An \"improved belief\" is proportional to the product of an \"initial belief\" and the probability that the \"initial belief\" generated the observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explicitly acknowledging prior information $I$, then Bayes' Theorem looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(M,\\theta|D,I) = \\frac{p(D|M,\\theta,I)p(M,\\theta|I)}{p(D|I)},\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Some vocabulary:\n",
    "* Prior information $I$\n",
    "* Model $M$\n",
    "* Paremeters $\\theta$\n",
    "* **Posterior** pdf $p(M,\\theta|D,I)$\n",
    "* **likelihood** of data is given by $p(D|M,\\theta,I)$\n",

    "\n",
    "On the other hand, think of measuring something (mass of planet, apple, elementary particle). The mass is **NOT** a random number; rather \"it is what it is and cannot have a distribution.\" Therefore the Bayesian formalism $p(M,\\theta|D,I)$ corresponds to the state of knowledge/belief about a model and its parameters, given data $D$ and prior information $I$.\n",

    "* **Posterior mean** $\\bar\\theta = \\int \\theta p(\\theta|D) d\\theta$\n",
    "* **Maximum a priori** (MAP) searches for best model parameters $M$ to maximize $p(M|D,I)$ (the analog to MLE from classical stats)\n",
    "* **Marginalization** means integration of $p(M,\\theta|D,I)$ over all other model paramters to get one of the paramters $\\theta$ (in multidimensional case)\n",
    "* **Hypothesis tests** (for Bayes) incorporate the prior and might give different results as the tests in classical stats.\n"

These affect the estimates, even if they're weak, so results are usually different from frequentist or MLE.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example is a **flat prior**, $p(\\theta|I) \\propto C$, where $C>0$.  Notice, that $\\int p(\\theta|I) d\\theta = \\infty$, so this is not a PDF.  It's called an **improper prior**.  \n",

    "There are 3 ways to assign uninformative priors.\n",
    "1. **principle of indifference** -- states that a set of basic, mutually exclusive possibilities be assigned equal probabilities (i.e. think of a dice, the outcomes have prior probability of 1/6) \n",
    "2. **principle of consistency** -- the prior for a location parameter should not change with translations of coordinate system; the prior for a scale parameter shoudl not depend on choice of units. For example, scaling by a positive factor $a$, then $p(\\sigma|I)d\\sigma = p(a\\sigma |I)d(a\\sigma)$, with the solution $p(\\sigma|I)\\propto \\sigma^{-1}$, called a **scale-invariant prior**.\n",

    "#### Principle of Maximum Entropy \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Entropy\" measures information content of a pdf.  The main idea is to assign **uninformative** parameters by maximizing entropy over a suitable set of pdfs, so the distrubution is \"least uninformative\".  You can add additional information about the prior distribution, such as mean value and variance.\n",

    "\n",
    "Some interesting details:\n",
    "* Can be justified using logical consistency and information theory (not sure what those are...)\n",
    "* Also called \"Shannon's entropy\" because Shannon was first to derive it, 1948.\n",
    "* Resembles thermodynamic entropy.\n",
    "* The unit for entropy is the \"nat\" (from \"natural unit, based in the natural log; if you use base 2, then the unit is the \"bit\", and 1 nat = 1.44 bits).\n",
    "\n",
    "The continous form of entropy is:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the \"measure\" $m(x)$ ensures that entropy is invariant under a change of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### An example: six-faced die (FYI: die is the singular form of dice) using Bayes!\n",
    "\n",
    "* If no specific information is available, then the **principle of indifference** says each outcome has a prior probability of 1/6.\n",
    "* If additional information is avaialbe, then adjust prior probabilities to be consistent. For example, maybe you know the mean value of a large number of rolls, $\\mu$.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two constraints for the 6 unknown probabilities $p_i$: the expected mean value is $\\sum_{i=1}^6 ip_i=\\mu$, and the sum is $\\sum_{i=1}^6 p_i=1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then to assign the individual values $p_i$, use **principle of maximum entropy** and the method of Lagrangian multipliers.  We want to maximize this with respect to $p_i$:\n",

    "    * For example, when the likelihood function is Gaussian, then conjugate prior is also gaussian. \n",
    "    * In discrete case, the most frequently encountered conjugate priors are the beta distribution for binomial likelihood, and gamma distribution for Poissonian likelihood.\n",
    "* ** Empirical Bayes** (a.k.a. Maximum marginal likelihood) -- refers to an approximation of the Bayes inference procedure where you use **data** in order to estimate parameters of priors (or *hyperparameters*).  \n",
    "    * This differs from standard Bayes, where parameters of priors are chosen before data are observed.  In Empirical Bayes, the hyperparameters are set to their most likely values. \n",
    "* ** Hierarchical Bayes ** (a.k.a. multilevel) -- the prior distribution depends on unknown variables (the *hyperparameters*) that describe the group/population level probabilistic model.  The priors here are called *hyperpriors* and resemble those of simple single-level Bayesian models.  \n",
    "    * This is useful if you want to use  **overal population properties** for estimating parameters of a **single population member**."
